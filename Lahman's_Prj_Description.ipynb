    "# Baseball Database Query Performance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project focused on exploring and implementing database optimization techniques using Lahman's Baseball Database, a comprehensive collection of baseball statistics from 1871 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "- Understand how database systems optimize query execution\n",
    "- Learn techniques to tune and improve query performance \n",
    "- Compare different optimization approaches and their trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Techniques Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Optimization\n",
    "- Created strategic indexes for frequently filtered columns\n",
    "- Implemented clustering techniques to improve data organization\n",
    "- Utilized materialized views for frequently accessed query results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Analysis\n",
    "- Used EXPLAIN ANALYZE to evaluate query execution plans\n",
    "- Compared execution times and costs across different approaches \n",
    "- Analyzed impact of different optimization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Join Strategy Optimization\n",
    "- Implemented and compared different JOIN approaches\n",
    "- Evaluated performance implications of each join type\n",
    "- Optimized multi-table queries for better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcomes\n",
    "- Demonstrated significant performance improvements through proper indexing\n",
    "- Gained practical understanding of query optimization techniques\n",
    "- Developed skills in analyzing and improving database performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- Deep understanding of database query optimization\n",
    "- Practical experience with performance tuning\n",
    "- Ability to evaluate and choose appropriate optimization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provided hands-on experience with real-world database optimization techniques, using a substantial dataset to demonstrate the practical implications of different approaches to query performance improvement."

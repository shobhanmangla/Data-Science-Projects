Baseball Database Query Performance Optimization
Project Overview:
This project focused on exploring and implementing database optimization techniques using Lahman's Baseball Database, a comprehensive collection of baseball statistics from 1871 to 2020.
Project Goals:

Understand how database systems optimize query execution
Learn techniques to tune and improve query performance
Compare different optimization approaches and their trade-offs

Key Techniques Implemented:

Query Optimization


Created strategic indexes for frequently filtered columns
Implemented clustering techniques to improve data organization
Utilized materialized views for frequently accessed query results


Performance Analysis


Used EXPLAIN ANALYZE to evaluate query execution plans
Compared execution times and costs across different approaches
Analyzed impact of different optimization strategies


Join Strategy Optimization


Implemented and compared different JOIN approaches
Evaluated performance implications of each join type
Optimized multi-table queries for better performance

Outcomes:

Demonstrated significant performance improvements through proper indexing
Gained practical understanding of query optimization techniques
Developed skills in analyzing and improving database performance

Learning Outcomes:

Deep understanding of database query optimization
Practical experience with performance tuning
Ability to evaluate and choose appropriate optimization strategies
